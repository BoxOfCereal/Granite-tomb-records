### 2025-04-25
I have used the library easy forms to add a working form to the website. Easy forms is located here: https://devapt.com/formeasy#formeasy_github

I added Captcha V3 to the website but it made it slow slow slow 🐌🐌🐢>📄

When throttling to regular 3G all of the images block the loading of the content I believe. This really sucks.

On the throttled 3G it took 36 seconds to load the page.

There is also no feedback on the front end about the form has been submitted or that you know the the message is still in flight.

#### TODO

- Add feedback to the front end about the form has been submitted or that you know the the message is still in flight.
- Add a loading state to the form.
- Add a success message to the front end.
- Add a failure message to the front end.

- Make it so the recaptcha only shows up on with the form.

## FUTURE WORK

It might be a smart move for projects that you really care about to publish a different branch for testing than deployment. So you can see what the site looks like not at the main domain and not interrupt the main traffic.

## Nunjucks Includes and Data Context in Eleventy

When using `{% include %}` in Nunjucks (as used by Eleventy), variables from the parent template's context (such as loop variables) are automatically available inside the included template. You do **not** need to "drill props" like in React or Vue. For example, if you are looping over `bands` and including a band card partial, the current `band` is available inside the included template:

```njk
{% for band in bands %}
  {% include "bandCard.njk" %}
{% endfor %}
```

Inside `bandCard.njk`, you can use `{{ band.name }}`, `{{ band.genre }}`, etc., directly. There is no need to explicitly pass `band` as a prop or argument to the include. This makes updating and sharing partials very easy across your Eleventy project.

If you want to rename the variable or pass a different value, you can use `{% set myBand = band %}` before the include, and then reference `myBand` in the included template.

#### issues
Launching the apps trip from the Google sheet with multiple accounts can cause a 400 error. The solution seems to beto sign out of all accounts and only use one account :/

> Thank you! You pointed me in the right direction. I was able to switch accounts by going directly to scripts.google.com (which loaded my personal account by default) and switch to my work account. This enabled me to access the scripts app, at least.

I was getting a 404 from my yaml file but it needs to be YML as per the decap spec.

## Images not showing up in the build

I am using 11ty to generate a static website and none of the images are showing up in the Kinsta build. However, the images *do* show up in the local build, and when I build them on netlify. 

I am using these build settings for Kinsta:

### kinsta
#### kinsta url
https://granite-tomb-records-2pjy7.kinsta.page/
#### Build settings

- command: npx @11ty/eleventy
- Node version: 20
- Root directory: src
- Publish directory: _site

That produced the following logs:

```

### My guess
In the build logs for netlify I can see that files are being copied And the `njk` files are being built. However, in the Kinsta build logs, `liquid` files are being built, but in my configuration, I have set the template formats to `md`, `njk`, and `html`.

This leads me to think that my configuration file is not being read by Kinsta.

I have tried to run `npx @11ty/eleventy --config=eleventy.config.js` and `npx @11ty/eleventy --config=./eleventy.config.js` but both deploys failed with a file not found error.



### eleventy config
```js
// eleventy.config.js  <-Located at the root of the project
const fs = require("fs");
const path = require("path");

module.exports = function(eleventyConfig) {

    // Set directories
    eleventyConfig.addPassthroughCopy("src/css");
    eleventyConfig.addPassthroughCopy("src/imgs");

    // Add admin directory decap
    eleventyConfig.addPassthroughCopy("admin");

    eleventyConfig.addCollection("galleryImages", function(collectionApi) {
        const dir = "src/imgs/gallery";
        return fs.readdirSync(dir)
          .filter(file => /\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif)$/i.test(file))
          .map(file => ({
            src: `imgs/gallery/${file}`,
            alt: path.parse(file).name
          }));
      });
    return {
        dir: {
            input: "src",
            includes: "_includes",
            data: "_data",
            output: "_site"
        },
        // Add template formats
        templateFormats: ["md", "njk", "html"],
        // Add markdown plugins
        markdownTemplateEngine: "njk",
        htmlTemplateEngine: "njk",
        dataTemplateEngine: "njk",
        // Add passthrough file copy
        passthroughFileCopy: true
    };
};

## Decap CMS & Eleventy Integration: Key Points (Updated)

- **Use Repository-Root-Relative Paths:**  
  All `media_folder` and `folder` paths in `config.yml` must be relative to the root of your repository, NOT relative to the config file. For example:
  - To target `src/imgs`, use `src/imgs`.
  - To target `src/imgs/posters`, use `src/imgs/posters`.

- **Never Point CMS to _site:**  
  The CMS should always read/write to your source files, not your build output (`_site`).  
  Paths like `_site/imgs` will break content management and cause entries to disappear.

- **Media Uploads Location:**  
  With `media_folder: src/imgs`, uploaded images go to `src/imgs`.  
  With `folder: src/imgs/posters`, poster entry `.md` files go to `src/imgs/posters`.

- **Entries Not Showing Up?**  
  If the CMS shows no entries, check that your `folder` points to the actual source folder containing your `.md` files, and that these files exist.  
  Avoid using `..` in paths—Decap CMS does not support parent directory traversal in these fields.

- **404 Errors in CMS Console:**  
  If you see 404 errors for paths like `/github/git/trees/main:../imgs/posters`, it's because Decap CMS does not support `..` in collection or media paths. Use paths from the repo root.

- **Eleventy Reads .md Files for Collections:**  
  Use a collection in Eleventy that reads and parses the `.md` files in your posters folder (using `gray-matter`), not just the images.

- **Consistent Structure:**  
  Keep all content and images inside `src/` for best results and to avoid confusion between source and build output.

- **Example Working Config:**

  ```yaml
  media_folder: src/imgs
  public_folder: /imgs
  collections:
    - name: "posters"
      label: "Poster Images"
      folder: src/imgs/posters
      create: true
      slug: "{{slug}}"
      sortable_fields: ['order', 'title', 'date']
      fields:
        - { label: "Title", name: "title", widget: "string", required: false }
        - { label: "Order", name: "order", widget: "number", required: false }
        - { label: "Poster Image", name: "image", widget: "image" }
        - { label: "Description", name: "description", widget: "text", required: false }
  ```

This setup is now tested and working!
