#### issues
Launching the apps trip from the Google sheet with multiple accounts can cause a 400 error. The solution seems to beto sign out of all accounts and only use one account :/

> Thank you! You pointed me in the right direction. I was able to switch accounts by going directly to scripts.google.com (which loaded my personal account by default) and switch to my work account. This enabled me to access the scripts app, at least.  
>  
> However, *I was still not able to access the scripts app from within a spreadsheet*. __The solution that finally worked was to sign out of all accounts in my browser and then sign back in to just my work account__.  
>  
> From now on I will use chrome profiles to switch google accounts rather than sign into multiple accounts in a browser session.

> Thanks again!

##### yml 404
I was getting a 404 from my yaml file but it needs to be YML as per the decap spec.

## Images not showing up in the build

I am using 11ty to generate a static website and none of the images are showing up in the Kinsta build. However, the images *do* show up in the local build, and when I build them on netlify. 

I am using these build settings for Kinsta:

### kinsta
#### kinsta url
https://granite-tomb-records-2pjy7.kinsta.page/
#### Build settings

- command: npx @11ty/eleventy
- Node version: 20
- Root directory: src
- Publish directory: _site

That produced the following logs:

```

### My guess
In the build logs for netlify I can see that files are being copied And the `njk` files are being built. However, in the Kinsta build logs, `liquid` files are being built, but in my configuration, I have set the template formats to `md`, `njk`, and `html`.

This leads me to think that my configuration file is not being read by Kinsta.

I have tried to run `npx @11ty/eleventy --config=eleventy.config.js` and `npx @11ty/eleventy --config=./eleventy.config.js` but both deploys failed with a file not found error.



### eleventy config
```js
// eleventy.config.js  <-Located at the root of the project
const fs = require("fs");
const path = require("path");

module.exports = function(eleventyConfig) {

    // Set directories
    eleventyConfig.addPassthroughCopy("src/css");
    eleventyConfig.addPassthroughCopy("src/imgs");

    // Add admin directory decap
    eleventyConfig.addPassthroughCopy("admin");

    eleventyConfig.addCollection("galleryImages", function(collectionApi) {
        const dir = "src/imgs/gallery";
        return fs.readdirSync(dir)
          .filter(file => /\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif)$/i.test(file))
          .map(file => ({
            src: `imgs/gallery/${file}`,
            alt: path.parse(file).name
          }));
      });
    return {
        dir: {
            input: "src",
            includes: "_includes",
            data: "_data",
            output: "_site"
        },
        // Add template formats
        templateFormats: ["md", "njk", "html"],
        // Add markdown plugins
        markdownTemplateEngine: "njk",
        htmlTemplateEngine: "njk",
        dataTemplateEngine: "njk",
        // Add passthrough file copy
        passthroughFileCopy: true
    };
};
```

## Decap CMS & Eleventy Integration: Key Points (Updated)

- **Use Repository-Root-Relative Paths:**  
  All `media_folder` and `folder` paths in `config.yml` must be relative to the root of your repository, NOT relative to the config file. For example:
  - To target `src/imgs`, use `src/imgs`.
  - To target `src/imgs/posters`, use `src/imgs/posters`.

- **Never Point CMS to _site:**  
  The CMS should always read/write to your source files, not your build output (`_site`).  
  Paths like `_site/imgs` will break content management and cause entries to disappear.

- **Media Uploads Location:**  
  With `media_folder: src/imgs`, uploaded images go to `src/imgs`.  
  With `folder: src/imgs/posters`, poster entry `.md` files go to `src/imgs/posters`.

- **Entries Not Showing Up?**  
  If the CMS shows no entries, check that your `folder` points to the actual source folder containing your `.md` files, and that these files exist.  
  Avoid using `..` in paths‚ÄîDecap CMS does not support parent directory traversal in these fields.

- **404 Errors in CMS Console:**  
  If you see 404 errors for paths like `/github/git/trees/main:../imgs/posters`, it's because Decap CMS does not support `..` in collection or media paths. Use paths from the repo root.

- **Eleventy Reads .md Files for Collections:**  
  Use a collection in Eleventy that reads and parses the `.md` files in your posters folder (using `gray-matter`), not just the images.

- **Consistent Structure:**  
  Keep all content and images inside `src/` for best results and to avoid confusion between source and build output.

- **Example Working Config:**

  ```yaml
  media_folder: src/imgs
  public_folder: /imgs
  collections:
    - name: "posters"
      label: "Poster Images"
      folder: src/imgs/posters
      create: true
      slug: "{{slug}}"
      sortable_fields: ['order', 'title', 'date']
      fields:
        - { label: "Title", name: "title", widget: "string", required: false }
        - { label: "Order", name: "order", widget: "number", required: false }
        - { label: "Poster Image", name: "image", widget: "image" }
        - { label: "Description", name: "description", widget: "text", required: false }
  ```

This setup is now tested and working!
